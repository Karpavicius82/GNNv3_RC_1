# GNNv3 — a weights-free graph neural substrate

A graph neural network built **without weights and without a trainer**. Computation
is carried by **phase, interference and superposition** on a unitary graph-wave
substrate; meaning lives in the **gauge-invariant flux**, not in stored numbers.

```
complex state z  →  Hermitian graph Hamiltonian H (topology + flux)  →  unitary evolution
```

## The three substrates

```
   FLOW                     DECORRELATION                 SETTLING / MEMORY
   unitary propagation  →   c = G^-1 ⟨k,q⟩           →    dissipative relaxation,
   (message passing,        (separate correlated          holographic recall,
    flux is the signal)      patterns; the glue)          amplitude amplification
   mix / spread             make content separable        sharpen / decide
```

One layer reduces to a single phase-weighted multiply-accumulate over edges,
`z_i ← Σ_j e^{i·δ_ij} z_j`; depth is `U^k`. No weights — the edge flux `δ_ij` is the
structure. Full description in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Headline results

| | |
|---|---|
| substrate physics | unitarity 1.2e-15, gauge/Wilson 4.4e-16, destructive interference 5.6e-31 |
| engine | **1,000,000 nodes**, unitary 2.2e-16, linear time; propagator exact at any t (1e-12) |
| GNN | classification **100%**, weights-free learning **99.5%** on unseen (shuffle 52%) |
| decorrelation glue | routing **1.000** where naive collapses to 0.48 |
| **real data (Cora)** | **77.4%** weights-free — beats label-prop (~68%), nears trained GCN (~81.5%) |

Full table in [`docs/RESULTS.md`](docs/RESULTS.md). Every number was run live;
nothing is fitted.

## Repository layout

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| [`tools/`](tools/README.md) | substrate core (`graph_wave_substrate.hpp`) + 62 C++ contract tests, including the GNNv3 RC1 feeling-gated carrier-field gate and self-sensing medium contract. |
| [`research/`](research/README.md) | production studies (scaling engine, decorrelation glue, the Cora benchmark) and honest exploratory probes, including negative results. |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | architecture, results, physics-only discipline, RC1 report and handoff. |

## Build & run (Windows / MSVC)

Each file is standalone C++20. From a Developer prompt:

```bat
cl /O2 /EHsc /std:c++20 /I tools tools\graph_wave_unitarity_test.cpp && graph_wave_unitarity_test.exe
cl /O2 /EHsc /std:c++20 /I tools research\probe_sparse_scale.cpp       && probe_sparse_scale.exe
```

CMake builds every contract and probe as a target and registers all C++ contracts
with CTest:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -C Release -L gnnv3 --output-on-failure
```

## Principle

Everything is **weights-free** and verified by **exact finite-N identities**
(unitarity, gauge invariance, exact interference) at machine precision — not by
fitted exponents or asymptotic claims. Where a result is uncertain or a probe
failed, that is recorded honestly rather than hidden.

## GNNv3 RC1 checkpoint

This repository now also contains the GNNv3 RC1 research checkpoint:

- `tools/graph_wave_v3_feeling_gate_contract_test.cpp`
- `tools/graph_wave_v3_self_sensing_medium_contract_test.cpp`
- `docs/GNNv3_RC1_REPORT.md`
- `docs/GNNv3_RC1_HANDOFF.md`

GNNv3 RC1 tests a self-sensing carrier-field substrate where `chi/tau` narrows
the active physics window. The main gate is C++ only, physics-only, uses no
trigonometric readout in the gate, and includes a signed-current/stress audit to
detect phase clipping. Project discipline for RC1: no Python/JS/notebook side
systems for core work, no SQL/database framing, no hidden negative results.

Latest 1M RC1 result:

```text
adaptive feeling-gated carrier:
  active_pairs=0.631
  psi compression=2.05x
  chi compression=3.56x
  sync_error=0
  CONTRACT RESULT: 8 / 8 PASS

self-sensing medium:
  active_edges=0.572
  psi compression=1.72x
  chi compression=2.03x
  internal support separation: psi=5.22 chi=9.24
  sync_error=0
  CONTRACT RESULT: 8 / 8 PASS
```

Latest CTest status:

```text
ctest --test-dir build -C Release -L gnnv3 --output-on-failure  -> 2 / 2 passed
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure -j 8      -> 62 / 62 passed
```
